# MoneyApp

This is a demo application designed to manage simple financial transactions, including payments, top-ups, and currency conversions.  Each screen serves a specific purpose, allowing users to view transaction history, perform transactions, and convert currencies.

The app uses SharedPreferences to pretend it's talking to a server. Transactions and balance are saved and updated on your device, so it feels like you're using a real API, but everything is handled locally.
